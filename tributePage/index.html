        <h3 id="headline"><u>Nikola Tesla: Timeline of Events</u></h3>

        <li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz after graduating from the Higher Real Gymnasium in only three years studying calculus and electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>1878</strong> - Left Graz after he became addictied to gambling and dropped out of school, also cutting ties with his family.</li>
        <li><strong>1881</strong> - Moved to Budapest to work for the Budapest Telephone Exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>1882</strong> - Moved to Paris to work for the Continental Edison Company and also identified the magnetic induction field principle.</li>
        <li><strong>1884</strong> - Due to his work, Tesla was requested to emigrate to New York City, USA to work for Edison and his latest projects.</li>
        <li><strong>1885</strong> - Telsa stepped away from the Edison company after non payment for his work and decided to venture on his own.</li>
        <li><strong>1887</strong> - Cofounded the Tesla Electric Company with Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. Together they developed AC applications as opposed to Edison's DC applications.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States and patented his famous Tesla Coil.</li>
        <li><strong>1901</strong> - Construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that the tower could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, however the project was never completed.</li>
        <li><strong>1934</strong> - The New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research.</li>
        <li><strong>1943</strong> - Nikola passes away alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3 id="headline"><u>Nikola Tesla: Inventions and Contributions</u></h3>
        <li><strong>1886</strong> - While experimenting with electromagnetic fields, Tesla noticed that these energitic fields could pass freely through materials. This eventually led to the discovery of <a id="tribute-link" href="http://theweek.com/articles/472881/5-crazy-inventions-from-mind-nikola-tesla" target="_blank">X-rays</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>1887</strong> - Improved and created a practical and working <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor" target="_blank">Induction Motor</a>. This is hailed as the first successful AC motor.</li>
        <li><strong>1888</strong> - Contributed to <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power" target="_blank">Three-phase Electric Power</a>. A common method of AC electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>1889</strong> - Duplicated Hertz's experiments to produce "electrostatic thrusts", otherwise known as <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy" target="_blank">Wireless Telegraphy</a>. This paves the way for the wireless transmission of radio and electromagnetic waves.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - Demonstrated and patented his famous <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil" target="_blank">Tesla Coil</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>1893</strong> - Invented the controversial <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_ray" target="_blank">Violet Ray</a>. A deviced used for electrotherapy.</li>
        <li><strong>1896</strong> - Invented and patented the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_variable_capacitor" target="_blank">Vacuum Variable Capacitor</a>. These enhanced the quality of electrical components for handling currents of high frequency and potential.</li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong> - Came up with the first <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control" target="_blank">Remote Control</a>. He demonstrated his remote controlled or "teleautomation" boat during the electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.</li>
        <li><strong>1899</strong> - Tested his famous <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla's_oscillator" target="_blank">Tesla Oscillator</a>. Otherwise known as the Earthquake Machine which was believed to have the power to bring down buildings.</li>
        <li><strong>1913</strong> - Patented the bladeless centripetal flow <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_turbine" target="_blank">Tesla Turbine</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - Rumor has it that this is when Tesla invented is infamous <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_ray" target="_blank">Death Ray</a>.</li>
